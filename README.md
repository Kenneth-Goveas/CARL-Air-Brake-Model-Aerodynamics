# CARL Air Brake Model Aerodynamics

This repository contains an aerodynamic modelling tool to support projects using the [CARL Air Brake][cab-repo] computer. The CARL Air Brake
computer automatically controls a rocket air brake in flight, so that the vehicle attains an apogee at the desired altitude. The modelling
tool provided here generates the necessary aerodynamic data from the rocket's geometry.

**NOTE**: *The documentation for this repository is currently in progress. When complete, this README will be updated and all documentation
will be available here.*
